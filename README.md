I sign up/login into the website, and I see a variety of classes available with resources.
I click on a class, and I am presented with a variety of learning materials, from past
study guides to past exams.  I can determine the quality of the help by a group voting
system.  Via the dashboard, I have the option to upload material of my own.  I have a ratio
of work submitted to work downloaded, which I need to keep at a certain level to continue
downloading resources.  This ensures that I help foster an environment of learning
by both learning from others and teaching.
